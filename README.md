Data science 2022
I've created a diabetes project it's goal to predict if the user has a diabetes or not from the given features in python , the main steps were:
Preprocessing:
● Data Collection.
● Data Cleaning/ Cleansing.
Feature Selection and Extraction:
● Using any feature selection methods.
● (optional) Visualize correlation.
Model Training:
● Train using Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree models , Random forest , XGboost ML algoritms.
Model Evaluation:
● Accuracy
● Precision
● F1 score
● Confusion matrix
